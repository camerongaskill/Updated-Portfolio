      <h2>Hi! I'm Cameron Gaskill</h2>
      <p>I’m a student over at Thinkful studying Software Engineering. I am 18 years old born
        in Boston, MA, and I currently live in Charlotte, NC. After being laid off due to COVID-19, I decided to make
        a career change from the welding industry into a field of tech.</p>
      <p>After graduating, I plan to move back to my hometown of Boston and begin my career as a software engineer,
        later on, I hope to specialize in cybersecurity with a rule such as a pen tester or possibly a security
        architect. I find the rapidly growing world of technology very exciting and I’m ready to begin my journey of
        life-long learning.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <P>After going through a number of introductory coding classes in high school, I was hooked on the endless
        wonders
        and possibilities of coding, the free-range for a developer’s creativity, and the ability of a whole team to
        make great changes in the industry. Even so soon in my short experience, the small victories I have from
        figuring out a small project show how perfect the field is for me.</P>
      <p>The most surprising part from the perspective of a newcomer developer is the amount of teamwork that takes
        place, the interaction between different, yet similarly minded people. Seeing each developer’s personality in
        their code is very interesting, and it feels amazing to work together on a task, getting insight from others
        you
        would’ve never had.</p>
      <p>Outside of coding I love being active; working out, hiking, camping, boxing, wrestling, hockey, you name it,
        I
        love to do it. One of my main passions is helping coach my alma mater’s wrestling team. I love the dynamics of
        both teamwork and being fully responsible on your own. I’ve currently been wrestling for about 10 years and
        have
        practiced Brazilian jiu-jitsu for 7 years.</p>
      <p>The service I hope to provide for my clients is to give each of them the Magnum Opus of web development. I want
        to
        create my clients the most tailored fit websites, with great care going into both the fron and backend of the
        site.
        If you’re looking for someone who’s not afraid of a challenge or someone who can help you with a small task,
        whatever it is, I’m the right person. I love to take hold of any opportunity I can to learn and perfect my
        craft, as management consultant Peter Drucker said, <em>“Knowledge has to be improved, challenged, and
          increased
          constantly, or it vanishes”</em>.</p>

        <p>This was also a assignment from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"
            target="blank"><em>Freecodecamp.org</em></a>. This assignment's focus was to create a simple form using a
          variety of inputs from the user. This webpage consists of skills using Html and CSS.
          <a href="https://github.com/camerongaskill/Freecodecamp-Survery-form" target="blank"><u>Here</u> you can find

          focused on making somewhat of a structure to a webpage. This webpage consists of skills using Html and CSS.
