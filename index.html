        <p>Hi! I’m Cameron Gaskill, I’m a student over at Thinkful studying Software Engineering. I am 18 years old born
          in Boston, MA, and I currently live in Charlotte, NC. After being laid off due to COVID-19, I decided to make
          a career change from the welding industry into a field of tech.</p>
        <p>After graduating, I plan to move back to my hometown of Boston and begin my career as a software engineer,
          later on, I hope to specialize in cybersecurity with a rule such as a pen tester or possibly a security
          architect. I find the rapidly growing world of technology very exciting and I’m ready to begin my journey of
          life-long learning.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <P>After going through a number of introductory coding classes in high school, I was hooked on the endless
          wonders
          and possibilities of coding, the free-range for a developer’s creativity, and the ability of a whole team to
          make great changes in the industry. Even so soon in my short experience, the small victories I have from
          figuring out a small project show how perfect the field is for me.</P>
        <p>The most surprising part from the perspective of a newcomer developer is the amount of teamwork that takes
          place, the interaction between different, yet similarly minded people. Seeing each developer’s personality in
          their code is very interesting, and it feels amazing to work together on a task, getting insight from others
          you
          would’ve never had.</p>
        <p>Outside of coding I love being active; working out, hiking, camping, boxing, wrestling, hockey, you name it,
          I
          love to do it. One of my main passions is helping coach my alma mater’s wrestling team. I love the dynamics of
          both teamwork and being fully responsible on your own. I’ve currently been wrestling for about 10 years and
          have
          practiced Brazilian jiu-jitsu for 7 years.</p>
        <p>If you’re looking for someone who’s not afraid of a challenge or someone who can help you with a small task,
          whatever it is, I’m the right person. I love to take hold of any opportunity I can to learn and perfect my
          craft, as management consultant Peter Drucker said, <em>“Knowledge has to be improved, challenged, and
            increased
            constantly, or it vanishes”</em>.</p>

            <img src="images/survey-form-project.png">
          </a>
          <p>This was also a assignment from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"
              target="blank"><em>Freecodecamp.org</em></a>. This assignment's focus was to create a simple form using a
            variety
            of
            inputs from the user.</p>

            <img src="images/tribute-page-project.png">
          </a>
          <p>This was my first website project. It was an assignment from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"
              target="blank"><em>Freecodecamp.org</em></a>. As you can see, it was a very primitive task that just
            focused on
            making somewhat of a structure to a
            webpage.</p>
